# Binance Trading App (Bot)

This is a Node.js binance trading bot that takes advantage of crypto's volatile prices.

## Theory

The prices of crypto go up and come down very fast, creating a gap of at least 0.5% every 5 minutes or so. That is for the more stable ones, like BTC. The rest even create a gap of up to 1.5% between the highest and lowest prices every 5 minutes! I call that gap WIGGLE_ROOM. ðŸ˜‰

Based on this observation, theoretically, it should be possible to profit from such volatility by picking the mid position of the oscillation, that is, the average price between the highest and the lowest prices of the 5 minutes, then subtract half of the WIGGLE_ROOM when buying, and add a half of the WIGGLE_ROOM when selling. Easy. But it is not, accuracy of this is very small. But have faith.

## Possible Risks

If you place an order at the bottom of the curve by mistake, the graph can continue moving up and you are left there, all alone. In such a case, when a few minutes expire and the order is not even partially filled, if it is a BUY order, cancel it altogether.

When the graph is already at the top of the oscillation when buying, even though we guard against this by doing averages, the selling price will be untouchable. So you have to sit and wait until the curve is high enough again so you can sell to remain profitable, this can mean a pause longer than a day.

At the moment, it is not possible to just cancel and place it anywhere else for the sake of it, the bot is not accepting losses yet. Until it can, we have to sit and wait.

Also, when the main asset tanks, you will go down with it, however, the tanking is not always very fast, so it is possible to place orders as it goes down unless you bought at the absolute top, which means you will have to sit and wait for a reealy loong time!

## Target

From initial tests, when the WIGGLE_ROOM is set to 0.3%, the number of trades averages between 2-3 in one hour. This means that considering the fees are 0.1%, you remain with 0.1%*3 which implies that you can make up to 0.3% of 98% of your principal amount every one hour. In 24 hours, if all goes well being overly optimistic, you can make between 4-7% of 98% of your principal. (The 98% comes from trading at least 98% of your mmain asset)

So say you started with 1000 USD, 98% of that is 980USD. Then, 4-7% of that is about 40-70USD each day. Which is decent to be honest.

So far, when the WIGGLE_ROOM is set to 0.5% in the DENTUSDT market, the average return is about 0.6% in 4 hours, translating to around 2-4% each day. Quite decent!

## Future Improvements

- Ability to trade multiple pairs.
- Ability to automatically determine the WIGGLE_ROOM for any given asset at any given time since the curves are not always just small fluctuations but giant leaps at times.
- Ability to take short term losses by selling low so as to keep following the curve.
- Ability to calculate and report profits at different times of the day depending on all the successful trades.
- Make it more configurable, everything should be configured even through an API, not necessarily through the settings file.
- Ability to send notifications to many other channels, e.g. Telegram, Slack
- Ability to consider TA indicators

## Running the Bot

Just edit the `settings.json` file to include your own preferences and your available asset as the main asset then `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose up -d` depending on your kind of medicine.

To run without Docker, edit the `settings.json` file accordingly and then run `npm install` then `npm run dev`.

Add your suitable settings:
